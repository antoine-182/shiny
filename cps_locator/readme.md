[Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Locator](https://cenuno.shinyapps.io/cps_locator/) is a Shiny app, a web app made using the R programming language.

The goal is simple: to make finding a CPS school of interest easier using open-source tools. 

As of August 27, 2017 deployment, here is what needs to continue to be done:

- [x] [Launch Version 1.0 of App](https://cenuno.shinyapps.io/cps_locator/)
- [x] [Post .R script of Version 1.0](https://github.com/cenuno/shiny/blob/master/cps_locator/app.R)
- [ ] Solicit feedback
- [ ] Build a regular expression tool that returns a list of CPS schools based on user-defined grade level(s) of interest
- [ ] Use the Checkbox Shiny Widget to allow users to filter which CPS schools appear on the Leaflet map based on the type of school (i.e. neighborhood, charter, military academy, etc.)
- [ ] Add CTA 'L' rail lines, CTA bus stops, and bike paths to indicate which schools are located near public transportation.
- [ ] Launch Version 2.0 of App
- [ ] Update .R script of Version 2.0

Thank you everyone for your feedback and encouragement on this project!
